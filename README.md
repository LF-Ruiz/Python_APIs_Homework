# Python_APIs_Homework
 This repository contains the homework for module 6.

 In this assigment I've been asked to answer the question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"


In this example, I'll be creating a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, I'll be utilizing a [simple Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy), the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api), and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.
